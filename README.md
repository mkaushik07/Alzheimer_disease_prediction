This repository showcases my project on detecting Alzheimer's Disease (AD) progression from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) by integrating two datasets. AD is a neurodegenerative condition affecting the elderly. Identifying MCI patients at high risk of developing AD is crucial. While structural MRI (sMRI) and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) show promise, their combined efficacy hasn't been fully studied. I integrated these techniques, using machine learning and deep learning algorithms, achieving a final model accuracy of 0.9986. My findings emphasize the potential of sMRI and rs-fMRI integration for AD prognostic prediction.
